# Community

### Welcome 👋

This is a space for people who are fighting fires (hopefully not a lot), managing incidents, setting up better processes, and putting in the work everday to better themselves and their teams 👏 

Here's what one can do:

1. Discuss - last fire fighting incident, on-call experiences (the good, the bad, and the ugly)
2. Need help in setting up Incident management procsses? We can help.
3. _for spike.sh users_ - Our team will share roadmap, ideas, and bugs (so can you). Please do upvote them and feel free to add your thoughts. 

This will be a small group which is super nice. Please be respectful and open-minded. 

Start with the [discussions tab](https://github.com/spikehq/community/discussions).

Thanks,

[Spike.sh](https://spike.sh) team😊
